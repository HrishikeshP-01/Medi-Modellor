# Problem Statement
- Doctors with visual handicaps such as color-blindness, short-sightedness etc. face lots of difficulties while interpreting 2D medical data like X-Rays and MRI scans.
- Itâ€™s hard and costly to directly make a 3D medical model.
- In most cases such as tissue cultures, direct 3D modelling is highly prone to errors.
# What it does
- It makes a 3D model form a 2D image with just 1 click.
- The 3D model can then be used in 3D softwares or visualizers to easily detect:
    -Fractures
    -Cancer Growth
    -Anomalies
    -Tumors, etc.
- Aids doctors with visual handicaps
# How I built it
Uses computer-vision and AI-based image processing & noise reduction techniques.
# Additional Perks
- Exports models into .stl files which can be easily manipulated using Blender and 3D object viewer.
- Further research work can be done on the models using 3D manipulation software.
# I hope...
**Medi-Modellor and apps like it empowers many visually-handicapped people out there who hopes to become doctors**
